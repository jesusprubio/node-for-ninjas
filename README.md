# Node for pentesters
A handbook for security experts who like JavaScript and javascripters who like (in)security.

## About this document
*Work in progress*

### Motivation
All we know [JavaScript is taking the world](http://githut.info/), moreover with the Node irruption the rules have changed and we can use the same language also in the server side. All kind of servers were written, specially those ones related with the web (ie: [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [are being succesfully used in the wild](http://nodejs.org/industry/). Two years ago we were using Node at work so, one day, we also started to use it to write our day to day security stuff. During this time we met with people doing the same. Furthermore since we started to write [Bluebox-ng](https://github.com/jesusprubio/bluebox-ng) we've been tracking the different security projects we found written in Node. Once we've finished the first stable version we decided to write this document to share what we learn. We think it's the better way to contribute to make the Node community still more awesome. Security guys are really curious and pragmatic, and most of them already know how to write (and break) JavaScript. So we're pretty sure they're going to enjoy the Node community ;).

## Why Node?
- One language to rule them all -> **Productivity**
- Performance
 - Asyncronous I/O -> **Fast** & Simple (vs. multithreading) (ie: scanner, brute-forcer, etc.)
 - Single thread -> **High performance**
 - Paypal: "Double number of req/s and reduced response time by 35% or 200 ms"
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): **126.258 packages** (at 17/02/2015)
- **Community driven**
 - [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) vs. [Node.jsÂ®](http://nodejs.org/)

## Usefull modules
- [How "require" works](http://thenodeway.io/posts/how-require-actually-works/)
- [Error-first callback](http://thenodeway.io/posts/understanding-error-first-callbacks/): CPS

### Examples
- Sockets
 - UDP
 - TCP
 - TLS
 - WS(S)
- HTTP(S)
- Request (redirection, etc)
- Ping
- Ping TCP
- Whois
- Traceroute
- External IP
- Geolocate
- Wifi scanning
- DNS resolve (dns-axfr)
- DNS reverse
- HTTP banner grabbing
- Host/Port scanning (Evilscan vs. node-portscanner)
- Nmap (libnmap)
- DNS brute-force (Subquest)
- Exploit searching (Exploitsearch)
- SHODAN API
- Fuzzing (Faker, Surku)
- Metasploit (msfnode)
- Radare (radare2-bindings)
- SIP ping
- SIP authentication
- MongoDB authentication
- HTTP authentication

## Owning the asynchrony
- for + maxSockets
- [Async](https://github.com/caolan/async)
 - Streams: [Highland](http://highlandjs.org/)

### Examples
- HTTP DoS
- Web path brute-force
- TCP DoS

## Writing our modules
- Boilerplate (Exploitsearch):
 - package.json
 - Patterns: [Singleton](http://thenodeway.io/posts/designing-singletons/) and [Custom Type](http://thenodeway.io/posts/designing-custom-types/)
 - Node inspector
 - Grunt :) vs. Gulp (streams)
 - JSHint+JSCS
 - Retire.js

### Examples
- Scanner
 - Arrays and objects powers
 - Complexity kills, careful
 - Lazy evaluation (Underscore vs. Lodash vs. Lazy.js)
- Brute-forcer
- Fuzzer
- Continuous pentesting

## Finishing touches
### Examples
- Cli
 - Manual implementation
 - Commander: Command line
 - Celeri: Command line and interactive
- Reporting: JSON
- Database: [Mongoose](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wy-Ijp__A2-ZSePUHXPMwpV19MqcNUX)

## Assaultjs

 - **Community**
 - Site: https://assaultjs.github.io/
 - IRC: #assaultjs
 - Twitter: @assaultjs
- **Framework**
 - Demo still not available, by the way the [Bluebox-ng demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-6k4Md3qEQ) is similar for now
